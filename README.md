# Warranty Telematics

Warranty Telematics is the area where insurance and reliability engineering come together. For this project, I have deployed the code for a R Shiny Project where we perform two things :

(1) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for Topic Modeling over our corpus of Insurance Claims
(2) Classification Algorithm on top of this to identify the warranty claims that can benefit from improved reliability engineering.

For this space, we have delved into Weibull distributions, reliability engineering and probablistic machine learning to improve the link between the world of insurance and improved reliability engineering by predicting the next claims that could come and proactively stopping this.


Any questions on this front, please drop a note to me at madhavansriram@live.com
