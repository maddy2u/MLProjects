#### Can we know the warranty & replacement rate of the specific part?
Yes, we can infer the warranty and replacement rates of specific parts using the reliability curve. 

#### How is the warranty time predicted?
The warranty time for each part is predicted using Linear Regression Analysis on the historical data of the past failures.

#### Why is topic modeling used for root cause analysis? 
In Root Cause Analysis we are clustering the defect details on the basis of their similarity using text mining algorithms. Of the various clustering techniques such as Hierarchial Clustering or LDA Topic Modeling, we chose the latter because of its capability to handle large datasets swiftly and without losing any critical information

#### Can we choose the optimum warranty period based on the data?
Yes, we can determine the optimum warranty period based on historical claims data analysis.

#### What are most common type of defects among the different parts?
As we can see from both WordCloud and Topic Modeling, the most common defect types are related to belt adjustment and tensioner.

#### In which area of the machines are the maximum defects observed?
Adjustment of the Belt.

#### What is reliability analysis?
When performing reliability analysis (also commonly referred to asÂ Weibull analysis or life data analysis), the practitioner attempts to make predictions about the life of all products in the population by fitting a statistical distribution (model) to life data from a representative sample of units 

#### What statistical distribution is fitted on to the warranty claims?
The statistical distribution followed by warranty claims is Weibull distribution. For more details on Weibull distribution, please click the following link: http://www.weibull.com/hotwire/issue14/relbasics14.htm
